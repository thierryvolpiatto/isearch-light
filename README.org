** Introduction

Isl like Isearch-light.
An Isearch replacement for Emacs.
Multi search expression(s) in symbols, words and/or lines in ~current-buffer~.

** Features

- Provide [[https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/isl                                                                   ?tab=readme-ov-file#about-multi-matching][multi matching]], a real minibuffer, no unexpected quit or
  errors and comprehensive mode-line indicators.

- Old position is always saved in mark-ring when exiting to a new place.

- Only one command =isl-search= for all which cycle in all matches
  without stopping.

- Select nearest match from your position, not necessarily after or
  before, this initial match can be reached back at any moment.

- When a region is detected search in this region only.

- Switch to query-replace.

- Allow jumping to =Iedit= at any time during the search.

- Allow jumping to =helm-occur= at any time.

- Allow showing only the matching lines with their context.

- Help available at any time during search without having to quit
  session.

- Allow resuming previous session in each buffer isl had visited.

It aims to keep simple with only the needed features, no extra
features you will never use.

** Dependencies

No mandatory dependencies, but for a better experience install [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] to
have =helm-occur=, [[https://github.com/victorhge/iedit][Iedit]] to allow jumping to iedit session and [[https://github.com/joodland/bm][bm]] to
mark interesting positions while navigating (if you use this you will
want as well [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-bm][helm-bm]] to retrieve later these positions).

** Install

*** From package

Isl is available in [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/isl.html][NonGnu Elpa]].
Use =package-install= to install it.

*** From source

Add isl.el to =load-path= and compile it.

Then add =(require 'isl)= in your init file.

Even better, you can autoload it:

#+begin_src elisp
    (autoload 'isl-search "isl" nil t)
    (autoload 'isl-narrow-to-defun "isl" nil t)
    (autoload 'isl-resume "isl" nil t)
#+end_src

** Configure

You may want to disable all =Isearch= global bindings:

#+begin_src elisp
    (global-set-key [remap isearch-forward] 'undefined)
    (global-set-key [remap isearch-backward] 'undefined)
    (global-set-key [remap isearch-forward-regexp] 'undefined)
    (global-set-key [remap isearch-backward-regexp] 'undefined)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-r") nil)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") nil)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s") nil)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-r") nil)
#+end_src

And then rebind the necessary keys to isl-* commands:

#+begin_src elisp
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-s")   'isl-search)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-z")   'isl-narrow-to-defun)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s") 'isl-resume)
#+end_src

You will find severals user variables prefixed with =isl-=, see M-x customize-variable.

NOTE: many of them can be toggled while in =isl-search= session, so
you may not need to modify them unless you want to change the default
behavior.

** Usage

=M-x isl-search=

The mode-line give you several infos, arrows up/down tell you the
direction where you are actually moving, the =>= and =<= mean you are
either below or above initial position in buffer. Regex or Literal
tell you the style of search you are using. Case sensitivity in use is
notified by ~*~, ~0~ or ~1~ which mean smart, nil or t for =case-fold-search=.

Don't forget =C-h m= which show you all these commands while
running Isl.

NOTE:  Another map =isl-mini-map= is used when excuting-kbd-macro, you may
want to modify it accordingly to fit with =isl-map=.

** About multi matching

By default =isl-search= uses multi matching like Helm, with limitation
to symbol, not line like in Helm, that means "foo bar" matches
"foo-bar" or "bar-foo" but not a line with "foo" and "bar" inside.

[[screen_shot1.png]]

when you want to match e.g. "foo some text bar",
you have to use regexp e.g. "foo.*bar" or switch to multi match line
matching with C-j aka =isl-toggle-multi-search-in-line=.

[[screen_shot2.png]]

To use multi matching, separate text with one space, each pattern
beginning by "!" will mean match everything but this, e.g. "foo !bar"
will not match "foo-bar" but will match "foo-baz".

[[screen_shot3.png]]

Note: You can jump to =helm-occur= for a line based search at any time.
You can also jump to [[https://github.com/victorhge/iedit][iedit-mode]] with multi match pattern (you may have
an error if all the matches do not refer to the same word or symbol).

** Isl vs helm-occur

Isl is a good tool for searching words or symbols in a
buffer and even if it can search several words separated by spaces,
helm-occur is more efficient for this as it is based on line searching.

Helm-occur is not efficient when you have to search in a buffer with
continuous text with no newlines e.g. some logs or debug logs
etc... you have better time using isl.

A good compromise is to start searching with isl and if it
turns out what you need to match is whole lines instead of words or
symbols, switch to helm-occur with =isl-jump-to-helm-occur= bound by
default to =M-s=.

UPDATE: Isl can now switch to a line based search like =helm-occur= easily.

** Use Isl for helm-help

Starting from Emacs-27 Isearch works more or less with unexpected
effects, you have better time using =isl-search= as the search command for
helm-help, here how to replace default setting by `isl` in helm-help:

#+begin_src elisp
    (with-eval-after-load 'helm-lib
      (autoload 'isl-search "isl" nil t)
      (helm-help-define-key "C-s" nil)
      (helm-help-define-key "C-r" nil)
      (helm-help-define-key "C-s" 'isl-search))    
#+end_src

An alternative is to customize `helm-help-hkmap` from the customize interface.
